I put together this demo as a first test of getting the Game Boy running.

It loads some tiles and a map, and then scrolls the background left.  It also adds a
spaceship that flys in the direction you control it, and fires bullets with the A
button.

It was tested using the TASM assembler and the NO$GMB emulator.

The "setpath.bat" batch file sets my compile paths to tasm.exe and rgbfix.exe.  The
"mk.bat" batch file runs my compile.
